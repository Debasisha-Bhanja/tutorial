Software development lets you move one step at a time toward your object-oriented goals, as well. 
The steps are composed of additional principles and implementation goals, 
such as those outlined in the SOLID acronym:
  Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
  Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
  Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
  Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
  Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
  
  SOLID principles provide a clear pathway for moving from tightly coupled code with poor cohesion and little encapsulation 
  to the desired results of loosely coupled code, operating very cohesively and encapsulating the real needs of the 
  business appropriately.
  
  The Single Responsibility Principle says that classes, modules, etc., should have one and only one reason to change. 
  This helps to drive cohesion into a system and can be used as a measure of coupling as well.
  
  The Open-Closed Principle indicates how a system can be extended by modifying the behavior of individual classes or modules,   without having to modify the class or module itself. This helps you create well-encapsulated, highly cohesive systems.

  The Liskov Substitution Principle also helps with encapsulation and cohesion. 
  This principle says that you should not violate the intent or semantics of the abstraction that you are inheriting from 
  or implementing.

  The Interface Segregation Principle helps to make your system easy to understand and use. 
  It says that you should not force a client to depend on an interface (API) that the client does not need. 
  This helps you develop well-encapsulated, cohesive set of parts.

  The Dependency Inversion Principle helps you to understand how to correctly bind your system together. 
  It tells you to have your implementation detail depend on the higher-level policy abstractions, and not the other way around.   This helps you to move toward a system that is coupled correctly, and directly influences that systemâ€™s encapsulation 
  and cohesion
